Task 5. Write a function that finds the first Fibonacci the length of the number is equal to or greater than $n. The length of the number can be quite large. You should try to find a Fibonacci number that is 100+ characters long.
Fibonacci numbers are the numbers characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.
Important! The use of the bcadd() function is forbidden. You need to write your own bitwise addition function.
Func args: (int $n)
